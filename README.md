Project Background

This project utilizes a Walmart dataset to simulate a deep-dive analysis into multi-branch retail performance. 
Retail environments are complex, high-volume ecosystems where thin margins mean that operational efficiency is everything.
I approached this as an In-House Data Analyst, treating the raw data as a direct feed from a Sales Revenue and Operational efficiency point of view.

Rather than cleaning the data in isolation, I focused on the performance gaps and operational trends that typically hide within large datasets. The goal was to move beyond simple reporting and identify exactly where the business is thriving and where it is underperforming relative to internal benchmarks.

Key Analytical Pillars:
Category 1: Inventory & Revenue Mix (Product performance and category dominance)

Category 2: Geographic & Branch Efficiency (City-level and branch-specific throughput)

Category 3: Temporal Traffic Patterns (Day, hour, and seasonal volume trends)

Category 4: Performance Gap Analysis (Benchmarking categories against company averages)

The interactive dashboard used to visualize these retail trends and branch comparisons can be found here: Walmart Sales Performance Dashboard
